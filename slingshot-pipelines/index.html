# Some of the Latest Additions to Slingshot

...and a bit more.

# Infrastructure as Code

--

# Goals

- Infrastructure defined in version control:
  - Changes to AWS resources driven by git workflows
  - Predictability, and better Disaster Recovery
  - Facilitate Peer Review

- Automation: do not require use of the AWS console


--

## How Slingshot Supports IaC

Cloudformation templates:
  - local JSON/YAML files within the same repo (we use the `supportFiles` feature to upload them to S3)
  - URLs [e.g. to an S3 bucket]

A Slingshot YAML file with `serviceType: infrastructure`:
  - List of stacks to be deployed: template and parameter values

--

## Full example

```yaml
project: slurp
serviceName: lullaby
serviceType: infrastructure
# ...

regions: [eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1]

supportFiles:
  buckets:
    filename: cf/buckets.yml
  somethingElse:
    filename: cf/somethingElse.yml
 
dryRun: {{ dry_run }}
 
stacks:
  - name: slurp-buckets
    template: $$FILES.buckets
    parameters:
      BucketSuffix: first
  - name: slurp-something-else
    template: $$FILES.somethingElse
    parameters:
      First: 'prefix-$$REGION-suffix'
      my_ami:
        customAmi:
          name: my_awesome_ami
```

--

## Multi-Regional Variations

*(Standard for all Slingshot service types, not just IaC)*

```yaml
regions:
  eu-west-1:
    defaultCount: 12
  ap-northeast-1:
    defaultCount: 6

stacks:
  - name: 'slurp-something-else'
    template: $$FILES.somethingElse
    parameters:
      First: 'prefix-$$REGION-suffix'
      Second: $$META.defaultCount
```

--

## Dynamic Parameters

Values that are **looked up upon deployment**.  
ATM we only support looking up a `customAmi`.

```yaml
supportFiles:
  vms:
    filename: cf/vms.yml
 
stacks:
  - name: slurp-vms
    template: $$FILES.vms
    parameters:
      AmiID:
        customAmi:
          name: my_awesome_ami
```

https://confluence.skyscannertools.net/x/lKHmAg

--

## Built-in Security Checks

Every stack goes through a security validation stage (**CF Ripper** by ProdSec),
where a (growing) number of security checks will be performed.

# Deployment Pipelines

Being able to orchestrate multiple workflows

-- center

## A look into a not so distant past

(when I joined Skyscanner in February 2017)

--

## Status as of early 2017
- Sandbox and prod require *separate drone steps*
- Each region requires a *separate drone step*
- If your repo deployed multiple components (e.g. microservices, lambdas...), each requires a *separate drone step* (multiply that by region and account combinations)
- All deployments happen *in parallel*

-- center

Loads of drone steps, one per account/region/service combination:

```yaml
# the olden days of drone 0.4
deploy:
  sandbox-eu-west-1:
    image: 325714046698.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/drone-plugins/slingshot-service
    endpoint: http://slingshot.eu-west-1.sandbox.aws.skyscanner.local/
    custom_parameters:
      tag: 1.0.$$BUILD_NUMBER
    when:
      branch:
        - master

  prod-eu-west-1:
    image: 325714046698.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/drone-plugins/slingshot-service
	# ...
    when:
      branch:
        - master
  prod-eu-central-1:
	# ...
  prod-ap-southeast-1:
    # ...
  prod-ap-northeast-1:
    # ...
```

--

## Improvements before Pipelines

Before introducing pipelines, there had been improvements of two types, towards:
- Consolidating deployments into fewer deploy steps (e.g. support for `regions`, `$$REGION` and `$$META`)
- Giving users some early form of establishing dependencies between workflows (a `dependsOn` keyword)

--

## One Slingshot to Deploy Them All

Goal: perform a **multi-service**, **multi-account**, **multi-region** deployment as a single orchestrated execution.

<br/>
The enabler for that are **deployment pipelines**. Within a pipeline you specify what elements will
be deployed where in which order.

--

## Pipeline Example

```yaml
serviceType: pipeline
serviceName: pipeline-demo
# ...

pipeline:
  - file: .slingshot-batch.yml      # external yaml
  - definition:                     # inlined definition
      serviceType: api
      serviceName: pipeline-demo
      serviceDefinition:
        cluster: "{{ ecs_cluster }}"
        role: ""
      taskDefinition:
        containerDefinitions:
          - name: "hello-world"
            image: "tutum/hello-world"
            memory: 128
      tags:
        Contact: "Iva"
        Project: "slingshot"
```

--

## Pipelines in the Slingshot UI

- Each individual deployment will appear in the service's page
- The pipeline is a parent workflow, the others are *child workflows*

![workflow-list](img/workflow-list.png)

--

## Pipeline Deployment Log

You can see an overview of the pipeline, and click through to step execution details

![pipeline-log](img/pipeline-log.png)


--

## Regional Rollouts

- Choose the rollout order for regions
- Combine serial and parallel regions for canary rollouts

```yaml
# define regions and rollout order
rollout:
  - [ap-northeast-1]
  - [eu-west-1, eu-central-1]
  - [ap-southeast-1]

pipeline:
  - file: .slingshot-role.yml
    regions: ['ap-northeast-1']     # regions this step will run in
  - file: .slingshot-k8s.yml        # no filter, deploy to all regions
```

-- heading

## Ongoing and Future Developments

- Multi-Account
- Extended Deployment Controls

-- 

## Currently under development: multi-account workflows

Deploy to multiple AWS accounts:
  - A **single Slingshot instance**, to deploy to any account
  - A single drone deployment step will be able to run deployments into multiple accounts

-- 

## ...multi-account workflows

Opens up possibilities:
  - A single workflow orchestrates cross-account deployments (e.g. deploy to a *sandbox account* and a *production account* from the same pipeline)
  - One of the account/region combinations (e.g. `canary/eu-west-1`) can be used as a *canary* - if deployment fails, it won't proceed further

-- 

## Future plans

- Pipelines:
  - Being able to pass outputs from pipeline steps as inputs to subsequent steps
  - Use the same template with different parameter combinations as a different pipeline step
  - Better options for parallelisation of pipeline steps
- Traffic Management:
  - Better control over traffic allocation during deployments

-- 

## Future plans

...and more importantly, things you will tell us about:
  - `<insert your requirements here>`
