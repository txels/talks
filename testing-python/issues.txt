# issues to find in tests:
# - punctuation is not processed correctly (e.g. "hello,").
# - articles and "common words" are counted
# - lyrics with non-ascii letters / hardcoded encoding
    # print(response.headers['content-type'])
# - songs not found, missing lyrics...
# - arbitrary answers when multiple words have same count
