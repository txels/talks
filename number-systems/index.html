# Number Systems

...or "is base 10 a good idea?"

-- heading

## Why do we use base 10?

-- center

We have 10 fingers (5x2).

<img src="img/hand.png" style="width:40vh; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"/>

We can count up to 10 with our fingers.

-- center

Hmm. OK. Got it.

But... how about beyond 10?

-- heading

Super abridged history of numbering systems

-- center

### Egyptian numbers (3000-1600 BC)

| = 1

^ = 10

<small><em>(egiptians wrote left to right)</em></small>

|||^^ = 23


-- center

Sounds familiar?

-- center

### <code>XXIII</code>

Exactly. Romans.

They adapted and extended the Egyptian system.

Symbols for 1, 5, 10, 50... multiples of 5 and 10.

-- center

### Babylonian numbers: 1750 BC

Numerical system with 60 as its base.

Rather than 60 different symbols, they use clusters of 10.

-- center

-- center

Babylonians being leading astronomers...

...the base 60 is still present in measuring time and angles.

-- center

### The place-value concept

<em>Another great Babylonian innovation.</em>

Value of a number depends on its location.

E.g. 222 - not all twos have the same value.

-- center

### Maya numbers (400 BC-150 AD)

Mayans also created a place-value system, using base 20.

They also introduced the concept of "zero".

-- center

-- center

### Hindu-Arabic numerals: from 300 BC

Base 10, place value system, includes zero.

Innovation: each number up to the base has a different symbol.

-- center

<img src="img/hindu-arabic.jpg" style="width:80vw; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"/>

-- center

### Zero

Sanscrit: <strong>sunya</strong> (empty)

Arabic: <strong>sifr</strong> - from where "zero" evolves

-- center

...it took a few more centuries for Europeans to replace the
Roman with the <em>Arabic</em> system.

<small>...until the middle ages. The church in Rome, Latin, y'know...</small>

-- heading

# Let's talk about 12.

-- center

## 12 is a superior highly composite number

A natural number which has more divisors than any other number
scaled relative to some positive power of the number itself.

-- center

A highly composite number, is a positive integer with more divisors
than any smaller positive integer has.

-- center

## In short, 12 is highly divisible, given its size.

12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. 

12 is the smallest number with four non-trivial factors (2, 3, 4, 6)

And the smallest to include as factors all four numbers 1 to 4

-- center

...in practical terms:

# There are 6 ways to evenly split a dozen

-- center

## Common uses of 12 and dozens

- A dozen of eggs
- 12 cans of beer
- 12x2 hours in a day
- 12 months in a year
- Twelve semitones in music
- Twelve bar blues
- ...

--

Babylonians used 12 as a unit for counting with fingers.

<img src="img/duodecimal-hand.png" style="width:30vw; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"/>

--

The first few superior highly composite numbers: 2, 6, 12, 60.

Used as radices for:

 - Binary (base 2)
 - Senary (base 6)
 - Duodecimal (base 12)
 - Sexagesimal (base 60)
 
 ...<em>the babylonians were up to something</em>

# Let's talk about six, baby.

-- center

## Demo

### why 6 is the best base to use for counting with your fingers
