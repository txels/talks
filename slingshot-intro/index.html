- What Skyscanner's deployment tool is
- What it aims to become
- How it fits within the rest of our enablement tools and platforms.

# The Single Most Trusted App to Deliver Changes to Production

# What Slingshot does for us Today

Deploy infrastructure and services to target platforms:

- infrastructure via AWS cloudformation
- microservices to Kubernetes and ECS clusters
- serverless workloads to AWS lambda
- AWS batch jobs
- state machines to AWS step functions
- ...

## How Slingshot Deploys Across Regions

--

# Basic Principles of Operation

- Deployment definition as Code
- Integrated with CI (via a Drone plugin)
- Multi-region/account deployment pipelines
- Metrics-based Blue/Green deployments
- Notifications: Slack, webhook, metrics annotations, github commit status

--

# Deployment definition as a YAML file

Includes:
- Service Metadata (some overlap with .catalog.yml)
- Type of Deployment
- Target Location: account, region, [cluster]
- Configuration specific to the Deployment Type
- Notification info

--

Generic Slingshot fields

```yaml
project: slurp                # metadata
serviceName: lullaby
serviceType: ...

accounts:                     # target locations: accounts and regions
- name: some-account
  id: "838493913463"
regions: [eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1]

annotations:                  # buzzsaw annotations
  enabled: yes
  extraTags:
    - deploy=lullaby-deployment

slack:                        # slack notification
  on_fail: yes
  on_complete: no
  webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
  channel: "#lullaby"
  build_author: <!subteam^lullaby-gf|@lullaby-gf>
```

--

Specific configuration based on deployment type - e.g. infrastructure:

```yaml
serviceType: infrastructure

supportFiles:
  buckets:
    filename: cf/buckets.yml
  somethingElse:
    filename: cf/somethingElse.yml

dryRun: {{ dry_run }}

stacks:
  - name: slurp-buckets
    template: $$FILES.buckets
    parameters:
      BucketSuffix: first
  - name: slurp-something-else
    template: $$FILES.somethingElse
    parameters:
      First: '$$REGION-suffix'
```

--

# Integrated with CI

Specify your deployment as a Drone step:

```yaml
deploy:
  image: 325714046698.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/drone-plugins/slingshot-service
  endpoint: https://slingshot.eu-west-1.prod.aws.skyscnr.com/
  custom_parameters:
    dry_run: yes         # referenced as {{ dry_run }} in .slingshot.yml
    secrets:
      boom: ${NUCLEAR_LAUNCH_CODE}
```

--

# Multi-Region/Account Deployment Pipelines

> One Slingshot to Deploy Them All

Perform a **multi-service**, **multi-account**, **multi-region** deployment as a single orchestrated execution.

<br/>
Within a pipeline you specify what elements will
be deployed where in which order.

--

## Pipeline Example

```yaml
serviceType: pipeline
serviceName: pipeline-demo
# ...

pipeline:
  - file: .slingshot-batch.yml      # external yaml
  - definition:                     # inlined definition
      serviceType: ecs
      serviceName: pipeline-demo
      serviceDefinition:
        cluster: "{{ ecs_cluster }}"
        role: ""
      taskDefinition:
        containerDefinitions:
          - name: "hello-world"
            image: "tutum/hello-world"
            memory: 128
```

--

## Regional Variations

You can specify variant configurations per region:

```yaml
regions:
  eu-west-1:
    defaultCount: 12
  ap-northeast-1:
    defaultCount: 6
```

Example replacement:

```yaml
                                  # Values when deploying to eu-west-1:
First: 'prefix-$$REGION-suffix'   # 'prefix-eu-west-1-suffix'
Second: $$META.defaultCount       # 12
```

--

## Regional Rollouts

- Choose the rollout order for regions
- Combine serial and parallel regions for canary rollouts

```yaml
# define regions and rollout order
rollout:
- accounts: ['sandbox']
  regions: ['eu-west-1']
- accounts: ['slingshot-test']
  regions: ['eu-west-1', 'ap-northeast-1']

pipeline:
  - file: .slingshot-role.yml
    regions: ['eu-west-1']         # regions this step will run in
  - file: .slingshot-k8s.yml       # no filter, deploy to all regions
```

--

## Pipelines in the wild

- [Test service definitions](https://github.skyscannertools.net/raw/slingshot/test-service-definitions/master/.slingshot.yml?token=AAACA8BoSRtw2hxvx2hOq_WhWSMb1IW0ks5cpHXdwA%3D%3D)
- [whostar](https://github.skyscannertools.net/raw/route-and-timetable-services/whostar-service/master/.slingshot.yml?token=AAACAw9hjQ0ggdSJIbH9UsRBoGUNgVB0ks5cpHThwA%3D%3D)
- [Gateway Infrastructure](https://github.skyscannertools.net/service-routing/gateway-infra/blob/deploy-inchmoan/.slingshot.yml)
- [K8s QPS clusters](https://github.skyscannertools.net/k8s/k8s-infx-cloudformation/blob/master/slingshot-pipeline-prod-qps.yml)

--

## Limitations

Pipeline deployments are a first MVP, IMO an unfinished product.

- There is no way to rollback a pipeline
- Usability is not great (neither in definition nor in UI support)
- They are not the default option in most cookiecutters
- No support for selective deployments

--

# Metrics-based Blue/Green and beyond

- We support both OpenTSDB and Prometheus metrics, for ECS and Kubernetes blue/green deployments
- Metrics checks can also be added as standalone steps in a pipeline


-- heading

# The Future of Slingshot

--

# Single path to production

With Slingshot being "the single app to deliver changes to production", we can have:

- A picture of what is deployed to production, by whom
- A centralised audit trail and timeline of changes
- A global Disaster Recovery / Rehydration mechanism
- A mechanism to control what can or can't be deployed (e.g. during an incident)
- Consolidated delivery metrics

--

# Extensibility

Add mechanisms so that non-Slinghshot-core engineers can extend deployment workflows.

- Generic workflows: webhook based custom workflows
   - already in beta use for Akamai configuration deployments
   - can be used within pipelines
   - could be used as validation / gating steps in rollouts (e.g. to run smoke tests)
